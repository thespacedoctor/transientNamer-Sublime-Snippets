# transientNamer Sublime Snippets

Here are a few Sublime Text snippets for working with the [transientNamer](https://github.com/thespacedoctor/transientNamer) python package within your own python scripting.


## Installation

There are 3 ways to install these snippets into Sublime Text:

### 1. Package Control (preferred)

If you don't have [Sublime Package Control](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control) installed, then [install it now](https://sublime.wbond.net/installation). Once installed:

* Open the Command Palette in Sublime (`ctrl+shift+P` or `cmd+shift+P`).
* Type "Install Package" and hit return.
* Type "transientNamer Snippets" and hit return.

### 2. Clone the repository into your Sublime Text 2/3 packages directory.

For example, on MacOS:

```bash
cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 3/Packages
git@github.com:thespacedoctor/transientNamer-Sublime-Snippets.git
```

### 3. Download the .zip file and uncompress into the Sublime Text 2/3 packages directory.

* You can find your Sublime Text 2/3 packages directory from Sublime by navigating to `Preferences > Browse Packages`.
* Download the zip file directory from this github repo into the packages directory, and double click to uncompress.
